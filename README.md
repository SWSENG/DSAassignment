Project Overview
Project name : WhiteFlag Donation
Type of Client program : Donation Coordination

WhiteFlag Donation is a console based staff-use platform that accepts donations from the public and provides financial assistance to those in need. In the programme there are 3 main modules which are donner management , donee management and campaign management .

In this assignment, I choose the Donor maintenance module which is to manage the donors who donate to the campaign. This module can be used to add, remove, modify, search, and generate reports.

In this module, I used a Sorted linked list to store the data inside. A sortedList is a Linear collection of entries of type T. An entry may be added at the end of the list . In the sorted linked list there are add, remove, contains, clear,getNumberOfEntries, isEmpty and getIterator functions inside this java file. 

Besides that, for the client java class, there are add donors, remove donors, modify donors, search donors, display all donors, and generate reports. Users can make their decision in this client java class.

After that, there is also a donor entity to get and set all the donor information, toString function and compareTo function also have apply in this entity java class. ToString function is to display the get donor information and the compareTo is to compare the donation amounts so sorted them by ascending format.
